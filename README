Backend route to create a new job

The backend expect at least one parameter 'URL'
| Parameters      | Description | required     | default value    |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |          ---: |
| url      | Url to the website to call       | yes   |    |
| frequency      | Frequency in minute       |  no  | 1   |
| method   | HTTP method        | no      |GET    |
| h:header   | Text        | no      |       |
| v:payload   | Text        | no      |       |

Only this method is accepted : ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']

```

To chain data on the payload

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
